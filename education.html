       <h2>First Day </h2>
       <p>Most teachers begin the school year by introducing themselves and discussing what you will be doing that year. Some teachers allow students to introduce themselves to the rest of the class.</p>
       <p>When teachers do the talking on the first day, they frequently go over classroom rules so you know what is and isn't acceptable. Pay close attention so you can determine whether you need to raise your hand to ask a question or what the rules are for using the restroom.</p>
       <p>On the first day, you may already know a lot of the students in your classes. However, today is a great day to make new friends, so try to say hello to both old and new friends.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Moving to middle school</h2>
       <p>After sixth grade, many students transfer to middle school or junior high, where lockers and maybe a homeroom are present. Just as it sounds, this is the classroom you will enter each morning to begin your day at school. For each topic in middle school, you might switch classrooms. Your teachers will assist you in adjusting as they are aware of how much this differs from elementary school.</p>
       <p>On the first day, most teachers let you choose your seat, but by the second or third morning, they'll have planned out a seating arrangement. To start, it's a good idea to note in your notebook where your seat is so you won't forget.</p>
       <br>
       <h2>Feeling good on Day one</h2>
       <p>The first day can be enjoyable if you run into pals you haven't seen in a while. By dressing in something you like, you can further enhance the feeling of specialness. Perhaps while on vacation, you picked up a beautiful T-shirt, or your new sneakers gave you a spring in your step. If you're wearing a uniform, consider accessorizing with your favorite watch, a trendy hair band, or some jewelry to 
         express your particular style.</p>
         <p>Having all the necessary goods on hand and being well-prepared might feel fantastic. Before the school year starts, several schools send out supply lists, allowing you to stock up on pencils, folders, and other essentials. After you've taken care of the necessities, you might put a few extra dollars in your backpack just in case (like forgetting your lunch money). Another option is to bring a book or magazine to read while riding the bus.</p>
         <br>
         <h2>Feeling bad on first day.</h2>
         <p>What if by the end of the first day, you strongly dislike school? Teachers advise students to give things some time to settle down; once you are familiar with the campus and their new routine, they should feel better. Speak to your parents, a teacher, a school counselor, or your teacher if those sentiments don't go away.</p>
